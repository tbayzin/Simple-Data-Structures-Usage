13. getFirst​(): This method returns the first element in this list.
14. getLast​(): This method returns the last element in this list.
15. indexOf​(Object o): This method returns the index of the first occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element.
16. lastIndexOf​(Object o): This method returns the index of the last occurrence of the specified element in this list, or -1 if this list does not contain the element.
17. listIterator​(int index): This method returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list.
18. offer​(E e): This method Adds the specified element as the tail (last element) of this list.
19. offerFirst​(E e): This method Inserts the specified element at the front of this list.
20. offerLast​(E e): This method Inserts the specified element at the end of this list.
21. peek​(): This method retrieves, but does not remove, the head (first element) of this list.
22. peekFirst​(): This method retrieves, but does not remove, the first element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.
23. peekLast​(): This method retrieves, but does not remove, the last element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.
24. poll​(): This method retrieves and removes the head (first element) of this list.
25. pollFirst​(): This method retrieves and removes the first element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.
26. pollLast​(): This method retrieves and removes the last element of this list, or returns null if this list is empty.
27. pop​(): This method Pops an element from the stack represented by this list.
28. push​(E e): This method Pushes an element onto the stack represented by this list.
29. remove​(): This method retrieves and removes the head (first element) of this list.
30. remove​(int index): This method removes the element at the specified position in this list.
31. remove​(Object o): This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list, if it is present.
32. removeFirst​(): This method removes and returns the first element from this list.
33. removeFirstOccurrence​(Object o): This method removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this list (when traversing the list from head to tail).
34. removeLast​(): This method removes and returns the last element from this list.
35. removeLastOccurrence​(Object o): This method removes the last occurrence of the specified element in this list (when traversing the list from head to tail).
36. set​(int index, E element): This method replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element.
37. size​(): This method returns the number of elements in this list.
38. spliterator​(): This method Creates a late-binding and fail-fast Spliterator over the elements in this list.
39. toArray​(): This method returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element).
40. toArray​(T[] a): This method returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence (from first to last element); the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array.
