<p> Linked List are linear data structures where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. <br> 
The elements are linked using pointers and addresses. Each element is known as a node. Due to the dynamicity and ease of insertions and deletions, they are preferred over the arrays.<br> <br>
   It also has few disadvantages like the nodes cannot be accessed directly instead we need to start from the head and follow through the link to reach to a node we wish to access. <br>
To store the elements in a linked list we use a doubly linked list which provides a linear data structure and also used to inherit an abstract class and implement list and deque interfaces. <br> <br>
