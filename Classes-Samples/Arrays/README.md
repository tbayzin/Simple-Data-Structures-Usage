Java provides a data structure, the array, which stores a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type. <br>
An array is used to store a collection of data, but it is often more useful to think of an array as a collection of variables of the same type. <br>

Instead of declaring individual variables, such as number0, number1, ..., and number99, you declare one array variable such as numbers and use numbers[0], numbers[1], and ..., numbers[99] to represent individual variables. <br>
